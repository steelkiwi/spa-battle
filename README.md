# SPA Battle

The goal of this project is comparison of most popular front-end frameworks in action.
We implemented the same simple Hero Book app with React, AngularJS1, Angular (^2), Ember and VUE.
The project is in development, after all implementations are done - we will try to compare pros and cons of each framework.

Each implementation sits in own branch (see [react](https://github.com/steelkiwi/spa-battle/tree/react), [angularjs1](https://github.com/steelkiwi/spa-battle/tree/angularjs1), [angular2](https://github.com/steelkiwi/spa-battle/tree/angular2), [ember](https://github.com/steelkiwi/spa-battle/tree/ember) and [vue](https://github.com/steelkiwi/spa-battle/tree/vue) branches).
